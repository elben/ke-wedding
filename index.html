    <h2>The Story</h2>
    
    <p>Anything we write about our story will inevitably be cheesy but that's okay. Love is cheesy. 
      Elben and Kristina met at UT through mutual friends. They quickly noticed how easily they clicked
      and became good friends. Such good friends that Kristina painted him an "Eye of Sauron" teapot
      that Elben still uses today and Elben would watch movies like Titanic and Serendipity with Kristina. 
      Then he asked her out. On a date, to be clear. She was nervous as this was very unexpected and she 
      was pretty sure she didn't have those kinds of feelins for him, but she went out with him just to 
      see. He was her best friend, after all. 
      
      Let's fastforward from here: The date ended in rejection for Elben and two months later he flew away to
      San Fransisco for the summer (not because Kristina said no, it was for his job). This is where the magic begins. 
      Kristina developed feelings for Elben that summer (while he was away). He came back, she told him, they 
      started to date. Then on December 27, 2012 Elben asked Kristina to be his wife. She said yes! (Hell yes, 
      to be exact). </p>
